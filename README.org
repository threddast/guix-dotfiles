* The GNU/Linux+Engstrand system

This is our opinionated, minimalist GNU Guix configuration.
It features [[https://sr.ht/abcdw/rde/][ =rde= ]], Emacs (evil mode) and various Wayland applications.

** Applications
We have patched some of our favorite applications with GNU Guile support and also created some tools from scratch in Guile, for example:
|---------------+--------------------------------+--------------------|
| Application   | Description                    | Links              |
|---------------+--------------------------------+--------------------|
| =dwl-guile=     | dynamic tiling window manager  | [[https://github.com/engstrand-config/dwl-guile][repo]], [[https://github.com/engstrand-config/home-service-dwl-guile][home service]] |
| =dtao-guile=    | a minimal status bar           | [[https://github.com/engstrand-config/dtao-guile][repo]], [[https://github.com/engstrand-config/home-service-dtao-guile][home service]] |
| =farg=          | system colorscheme manager     | [[https://github.com/engstrand-config/farg][repo/home service]]  |
| =bemenu-prompt= | create =bemenu= prompts in Guile | [[https://github.com/engstrand-config/guix-dotfiles/blob/main/engstrand/utils/bemenu-prompt.scm][source]]             |
|---------------+--------------------------------+--------------------|

We like configuring as much as possible (WM, status bar etc.) in Guile, since it brings a unified approach to the configuration of our computing environment.
# This allows us to keep track of and reproduce configuration settings with the help of Guix derivations.

** System level configuration
We own a number of desktop/laptop computers and they all have their own configuration file in =./engstrand/systems=.
In the system-specific configuration file we define hardware-specific settings such as mount points for drives, LUKS encryption, the resolution and refresh rate of monitors and more.

** User-level configuration
Our user-level configurations reside in =./engstrand/configs=.
This includes name, email address, GPG public key, default applications, personalized appearance of the window manager etc.

** Reconfiguring the system
The entry point for applying a configuration to our =rde=-powered Guix system is =~/.config/guix/config.scm=, so in order to reconfigure the system we run
#+begin_src sh
RDE_USER=$USER \
RDE_TARGET=system \
sudo guix system reconfigure ~/.config/guix/config.scm
#+end_src
and similarly, to reconfigure the home environment
#+begin_src sh
RDE_USER=$USER \
RDE_TARGET=home \
guix home reconfigure ~/.config/guix/config.scm
#+end_src

So, what is in =~/.config/guix/config.scm=?
That depends on the user and system configuration we would like to apply. For example, on the desktop system named =ghost= that the user =johan= uses, =config.scm= contains the following:
#+begin_src scheme
(use-modules (engstrand reconfigure))
(make-config #:user "johan" #:system "ghost")
#+end_src

** Building an installation ISO
The =build-iso.sh= script builds a GNU Guix System ISO that has
- the full Linux kernel
- the channels in =./engstrand/channels.scm= included
